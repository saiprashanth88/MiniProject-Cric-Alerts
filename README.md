As we all know we watch cricket we admire we get thrilled  and sometimes we also want to
 share the cricket match scores . But for that we have to type the score manually or we have to
 say our friends please watch match is wonderful  their batting or bowling excellently. So why
 canâ€™t a platform be there where everyone knows the score and we can connect and share our
 reactions to that.
So by taking this as a problem statement for our  mini Projects we have come with a solution.
For this we have to select a platform so we have selected telegram as a as our platform this is
 very simple and reliable application.
