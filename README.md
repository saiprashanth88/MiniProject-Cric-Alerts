As we all know we watch cricket we admire we get thrilled  and sometimes we also want to
 share the cricket match scores . But for that we have to type the score manually or we have to
 say our friends please watch match is wonderful  their batting or bowling excellently. So why
 can’t a platform be there where everyone knows the score and we can connect and share our
 reactions to that.
So by taking this as a problem statement for our  mini Projects we have come with a solution.
For this we have to select a platform so we have selected telegram as a as our platform this is
 very simple and reliable application. 
 
We all like the cricket game, especially India vs Pakistan and India vs Australia matches are 
very interesting and we enjoy the match. As many people want to watch the match live in 
the stadium, but only some people can get the chance of watching the live, due to some
 reasons like not having enough seats in the stadium, money problem, etc. So, people
 will search in the websites to watch the live score, but sometimes it takes some time for 
the process and etc.We took the problem and we want to solve this problem by creating
 the telegram bot. This bot can show the live score of live matches and by and this telegram
 bot can show the every detail of the match live.But the thing with these websites is that 
you have to keep staring at the page or refreshing it to get the latest score which can be 
quite unproductive if you are in the middle of important work.But in this case we don’t
 have that type of problem because it automatically updates itself.
